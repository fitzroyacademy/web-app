        <h3>Why are we doing this?</h3>
        <p><strong>First up,</strong> we think it&rsquo;s a good teaching and learning practice.</p>
        <p><strong>Secondly,</strong> we had a long conversation with some partners and funders about social sector folks making the same mistakes over and over without sharing.</p>

        <h3>Foolish themes!</h3>
        <p>When we wrote down a list our screw-ups, we noticed some themes.</p>
        <p>Pretty much all of our mistakes fit within one of these categories:</p>

            <dd>
              <p><strong>Late 2016:</strong> We hired a (great) staff member before we had enough work for them, then ran out of work for them <em>and</em> money to pay their wage all at once.</p> 
              <p>We had to let them go and felt crappy.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><i class="far fa-clock"></i> Why did it happen?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>We had enough cash in the bank to wear the hire, and expected we'd need them once we won a big, upcoming grant. We didn't win the big grant. ðŸ˜£</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><i class="far fa-heart"></i> How we fixed it.</dt>
            <dd>We helped that staff member get another job with a friend, and gave them 6 weeks to leave. In retrospect this probably wasn't a great idea either.</dd>
            
            <dt><i class="far fa-comments-alt"></i> Real talk, what <em>actually</em> happened?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>We should have waiting longer to hire. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Hire+slow%2C+fire+fast" target="_blank">Hire slow! Duh.</a> We didn't desperately need this person, so we couldn't define their job well and make it valuable.</p>
              <p>On the flip-side, a year later it took is 3-4 months longer to hire than it should have for another role, which hurt us in other ways. Argh!</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><i class="far fa-tachometer-alt-fast"></i> Spiciness:</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>We lost more money and time on this than we want to admit. Ouch.</p>

            <dd>
              <p><strong>2016:</strong> We moved into a studio space we couldn&rsquo;t afford.</p>
              <p>It was nice to have a decent place to work, but we didn't think it through, didn't really get along with our studio-mates (good people, we were just too different in style to them).</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><i class="far fa-clock"></i> Why did it happen?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>We had just won a grant and thought we would get more. We wanted to be a 'real' company with space that people could visit, run workshops, etc. We ended up running maybe one or two workshops.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><i class="far fa-heart"></i> How we fixed it.</dt>
            <dd>We moved out. It burnt a bunch of money and time, but now we work distributed. Will and Leo work most of the time in Will's loungeroom! We love it.</dd>
            
            <dt><i class="far fa-comments-alt"></i> Real talk, what <em>actually</em> happened?</dt>
            <dd>We assumed that studio space was needed when it probably wasn't. We also had a decent-but-not-great relationship with the other company we shared the space with, which meant neither they or we got the full use of the space we wanted. The compromise was crappy for everyone.</dd>
