  <dt><i class="far fa-question-square"></i> What happened to the online canvases?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p><strong>We got rid of them. Sorry!</strong> We found out that most students prefer to use Google Docs, and it's hard to make online canvases work on mobile phones.</p>
    <p>If you want to do your canvases online, check out <a href="https://cnvs.online" target="_blank">cnvs.online</a>, it's nice.</p>
