				        	<p>I believe the future of healthcare is based on quality of life and compassion-based approaches, moving beyond just 'fixing' a physiological problem. </p>
									<p>Every person has a set of values and principles that are important to them and encompass their health. These should be addressed during any healthcare journey to ensure they leave better than when they arrived and improve the chances of long-term well-being.</p>
									<p>For the past five years I focused on human sexuality, an aspect of health often ignored and forgotten within someone's healthcare journey. Many people value sexual connection as part of their identity and overall well-being. Prostate cancer treatment commonly leads to physical side effects that impact this core value and there is a gap in solutions and strategies within the healthcare system to help.</p>
									<p>Through my current PhD research, hundreds of conversations with men and their partners and a passion to innovate the patient journey I have created a website for conversation and practical resources : A Touchy Subject (www.atouchysubject.com)</p>
									<p>I consult patients privately from Associate Professor Declan Murphy's practice, Cancer Specialists.</p>
