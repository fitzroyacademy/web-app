        <h2>Why partnership is so important.</h2> 
        <p>We could never do it alone.</p>
        <p>To get anywhere near the scope of the problem, the world requires huge, unilateral, co-operative action. It's why we can <strong>only</strong> work in partnership with other smart organisations to get it done.</p>
        <p>In the last 5 years of work we've changed, and the idea of building things and selling them to people seems really dumb. Building things with people that solve long term problems is just way more fun, and infinitely more effective.</p>

          <p>When we first started the Fitzroy Academy it was a fast, take-no-prisoners expression of frustration with education and the pace of social change.</p>
          <p>It wasn't until we started working with our partners that we realised we might be able to make a real dent, and make it stick.</p>
          <p>These folks make the work possible with a sincerity that we never originally imagined.</p>

        <h2>Want to partner with us?</h2>
        <p>Firstly: Yay!</p>
        <p>Secondly: Yaaay!</p>
        <p>We like to work with funds, schools, and institutes who have a long view and agile principles, who don't make compromises about quality and efficiency.</p>
        <p>In general, partnership includes making films together, working on tech, and finding ways to very cheaply and efficiently further our missions together.</p>
