      <p>We had a long conversation with partners, funders and friends about social sector people making mistakes over and over without sharing, and how hard it is to share. We're doing our bit!</p>

              <dd>
                <p><strong>Late 2016:</strong> We hired a (great) staff member before we had enough work for them, then ran out of work for them <em>and</em> money to pay their wage all at once.</p> 
                <p>We had to let them go and it felt real crappy.</p>

              <dd>
                <p>We had enough cash in the bank to wear the hire, and expected we'd need them once we won a big, upcoming grant. We didn't win the big grant. ðŸ˜£</p>
                <p>Also we just <em>liked</em> them and figured we'd find the work to justify the hire. This was really dumb in retrospect.</p>

              <dd>
                <p>We helped that staff member get another job at a friend's company, and gave them 6 weeks to leave. In retrospect this probably wasn't a great idea either, and we should have made the firing decision earlier.</p>

                <p>On the flip-side, a year later it took is 3-4 months longer to hire than it should have for another role, which hurt us in other ways. Argh!</p>

                <p><strong>2016-17:</strong> We moved into a studio space we couldn&rsquo;t afford.</p>
                <p>It was nice to have a place to work, but we didn't think it through, didn't totally click with our studio-mates (good people, we were just too different in work style to them).</p>

              <dd>
                <p>We had just won a big customer and expected to get more quickly. We wanted to be a &lsquo;real&rsquo; company with space that people could visit, run workshops in, etc. We ended up running maybe one or two workshops and could have done most of this stuff from a co-working space or home.</p>

                <p>We assumed that studio space was needed when it probably wasn't. We also had a decent-but-not-great relationship with the other company we shared the space with, which meant neither they or we got the full use of the space we wanted.</p>
                <p>The compromise was lame for everyone.</p>

                <p>We also assume that it will get cheaper over time, but the opposite is true. It costs the same amount and takes just as long (if not longer), but we get a better result. But that better result doesn't happen faster or cheaper.</p>
