    <h3>Q: Why do this?</h3>
    <p>After long conversations with partners, funders and friends about the social sector we felt we had to do something. So many screw ups are swept under the rug. Making big mistakes and writing shiny reports is commonplace.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>Q: Are you sharing everything?</h3>
    <p><strong>Nope.</strong> We're only sharing our clear, big mistakes that other folks might learn from and we are anonymising to protect employees, partners and friends.</p>
    <p>The goal here is to be honestly self-critical, not create failure porn or 'out' anyone.</p>

    <h3>Q: Has this been done before?</h3>
    <p><strong>Yes!</strong> The <a href="https://www.admittingfailure.org/" target="_blank">admittingfailure.com</a> site is a wonderful NGO resource.</p>
    <p>See <a href="http://startupgraveyard.io/" target="_blank">startupgraveyard.io</a> and <a href="https://www.failory.com/cemetery" target="_blank">failory.com/cemetery</a> for the startup side.</p>

                <p>It was nice to have a place to work, but we didn't think it through, didn't totally click with our studio-mates (good people, we were just too different in work style to them).</p>
