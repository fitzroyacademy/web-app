      <h1>Sharing our  dumb mistakes.</h1>
      <p>Hopefully you don't have to make them again.</p>
      <p><strong>We&rsquo;re doing this</strong> because we think it&rsquo;s good teaching and learning.</p>
      <p><strong>Also,</strong> we had a long conversation with some partners and funders about social sector folks making the same mistakes over and over without sharing.</p>

      <h3>Foolish themes!</h3>
      <p>When we wrote down a list our screw-ups, we noticed some themes.</p>
      <p>Pretty much all of our mistakes fit within one of these categories:</p>

              <dd>
                <p><strong>Late 2016:</strong> We hired a (great) staff member before we had enough work for them, then ran out of work for them <em>and</em> money to pay their wage all at once.</p> 
                <p>We had to let them go and it felt real crappy.</p>
              </dd>
              <dt><i class="far fa-clock"></i> Why did it happen?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>We had enough cash in the bank to wear the hire, and expected we'd need them once we won a big, upcoming grant. We didn't win the big grant. ðŸ˜£</p>
                <p>Also we just <em>liked</em> them and figured we'd find the work to justify the hire. This was really dumb in retrospect.</p>

              <dt><i class="far fa-heart"></i> How we fixed it.</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>We helped that staff member get another job at a friend's company, and gave them 6 weeks to leave. In retrospect this probably wasn't a great idea either, and we should have made the firing decision earlier.</p>
              </dd>
              
              <dt><i class="far fa-comments-alt"></i> Real talk, what <em>actually</em> happened?</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>We should have waiting longer to hire. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Hire+slow%2C+fire+fast" target="_blank">Hire slow! Duh.</a> We didn't desperately need this person, so we couldn't define their role well enough to make it valuable.</p>
                <p>On the flip-side, a year later it took is 3-4 months longer to hire than it should have for another role, which hurt us in other ways. Argh!</p>

                <p><strong>2016:</strong> We moved into a studio space we couldn&rsquo;t afford.</p>
                <p>It was nice to have a place to work, but we didn't think it through, didn't totally click with our studio-mates (good people, we were just too different in work style to them).</p>

                <p>We had just won a big customer and expected to get more quickly. We wanted to be a &lsquo;real&rsquo; company with space that people could visit, run workshops in, etc. We ended up running maybe one or two workshops and could have done most of this stuff from a co-working space or home.</p>
